# Usage: ./ReconForge.sh example.com
# Requirements: subfinder, dig, python3, nmap
#
# Descriptionn:
# ReconForge â€” finds subdomains, drops CDN junk, and runs Nmap on the real hosts.
#
# Workflow:
#  1) creates directory ./<target> and places everything inside
#  2) subfinder -> ./<target>/<target>_subdomains.txt
#  3) resolve A only -> ./<target>/<target>_iptemp.txt
#  4) dedupe -> ./<target>/<target>_ipunque.txt
#  5) filter Cloudflare + Vercel CIDRs -> ./<target>/<target>_ip.txt (final)
#  6) write removed/blocked IPs to ./<target>/<target>_blocked_ips.txt
#  7) remove intermediate files (_iptemp, _ipunque)
#  8) run nmap -A -T4 -v -p- -iL <final> -oA <target>_nmap (outputs inside target dir)
#
# Filenames inside folder:
#   <target>_subdomains.txt
#   <target>_iptemp.txt
#   <target>_ipunque.txt
#   <target>_blocked_ips.txt
#   <target>_ip.txt
#   <target>_nmap.nmap/.gnmap/.xml
